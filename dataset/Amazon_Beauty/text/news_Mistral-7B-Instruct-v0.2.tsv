While ingesting vitamin C through supplements or food is beneficial for overall health, topical application is more effective for targeting facial aging. Vitamin C plays a crucial role in collagen production, a protein responsible for skin elasticity. As collagen breaks down with age, wrinkles form. By maintaining optimal vitamin C levels in the skin, collagen production can be increased, preventing wrinkles and improving elasticity within two weeks.
